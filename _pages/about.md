Hi, there! I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://github.com/tmlr-group">Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group (TMLR)</a> in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=eqe3JS8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr.Feng Liu</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/liuhua-peng">Dr.Liuhua Peng</a>. I received my Master degree from the <a href="https://ai.nju.edu.cn/">School of Artificial Intelligence</a> at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/">Nanjing University</a> in 2024, where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/gaow/">Dr.Wei Gao</a>. During my Master's studies, I was a member of the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx">LAMDA Group</a>, led by Professor <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/">Zhihua Zhou</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree of Transportation Engineering from <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology</a> in 2021. 

As of now, my research interests lie in:
</p>
<li>Data-adaptive Non-parametric Hypothesis Testing</li>
<li>Conformal Prediction with Statistics</li>
